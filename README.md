# Hi there

Let me say two things beforehand:

War ist **NOT** the right answer! It is never the right answer. It was not the
right thing to do in Serbia, Syria, Afghanistan or Iraq, and it is also not the
right thing to do in Ukraine. If you want to do something with weapons,
disassemble them and make something useful out of it.

And you can do more than praying, you can
[take action](https://www.goodgoodgood.co/articles/how-to-help-ukraine).
